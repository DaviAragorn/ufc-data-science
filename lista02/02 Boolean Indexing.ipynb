    "# Selecting Subsets of Data in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is also available as a [blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-39e811c81a0c).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Boolean Indexing\n",
    "This is part 2 of a seven-part series on how to select subsets of data from a pandas DataFrame or Series. Pandas offers a wide variety of options for subset selection which necessitates multiple articles. This series is broken down into the following 7 topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selection with `[]`, `.loc` and `.iloc`\n",
    "1. Boolean indexing\n",
    "1. Assigning subsets of data\n",
    "1. Selection with a MultiIndex\n",
    "1. Selecting subsets of data with methods\n",
    "1. Selections with other Index types\n",
    "1. Internals, Miscellaneous, and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 vs Part 2 subset selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of this series covered subset selection with `[]`, `.loc` and `.iloc`. All three of these **indexers** use either the row/column labels or their integer location to make selections. The actual **data** of the Series/DataFrame is not used at all during the selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2 of this series, on **boolean indexing**, we will select subsets of data based on the actual values of the data in the Series/DataFrame and NOT on their row/column labels or integer locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation on boolean selection\n",
    "I will always recommend reading the official documentation in addition to this tutorial when learning about boolean selection. The documentation uses more formal examples with dummy data, but is still an excellent resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation use the term **boolean indexing** but you will also see **boolean selection**.\n",

    "## Stack Overflow Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we will use for this tutorial comes from [Stack Overflow's data explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new), which is a fantastic tool to gather an incredible amount of data from the site. You must know SQL in order to use the data explorer. The data explorer allows you to save queries. [Take a look at the query](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/768430/get-all-questions-and-answerers-from-tag) I used to collect the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first question was asked March 30, 2011. Since then, more than 56,000 questions have been added as of December 2, 2017."

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Boolean Indexing** or **Boolean Selection** is the selection of a subset of a Series/DataFrame based on the values themselves and not the row/column labels or integer location\n",
    "* Boolean selection is used to answer common queries like \"find all the female engineers with a salary over 150k/year\"\n",
    "* To do boolean selection, you first create a sequence of True/False values and pass it to a DataFrame/Series indexer\n",
    "* Each row of data is kept or discarded\n",
    "* The indexing operators are **overloaded** - change functionality depending on what is passed to them\n",
    "* Typically, you will first create a boolean Series with one of the 6 comparison operators\n",
    "* You will pass this boolean series to one of the indexers to make your selection\n",
    "* Use the **`isin`** method to test for multiple equalities in the same column\n",
    "* Use **`isnull`** to find all rows with missing values in a particular column\n",
    "* Can use the **`between`** Series method to test whether Series values are within a range\n",
    "* You can create complex criteria with the **and** (**`&`**), **or** (**`|`**), and **not** (**`~`**) logical operators\n",
    "* When you have multiple conditions in a single line, you must wrap each expression with a parentheses\n",
    "* If you have complex criteria, think about storing each set of criteria into its own variable (i.e. don't do everything in one line)\n",
    "* If you are only selecting rows, then you will almost always use *just the indexing operator*\n",
    "* If you are simultaneously doing boolean selection on the rows and selecting column labels then you will use **`.loc`**\n",
    "* You will almost never use **`.iloc`** to do boolean selection\n",
    "* Boolean selection works the same for Series as it does for DataFrames"
