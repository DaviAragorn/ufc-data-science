    "# Selecting Subsets of Data in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is also available as a [blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-part-3-d5704b4b9116).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Assigning subsets of data\n",
    "This is part 3 of a 7-part series on how to select subsets of data from a pandas DataFrame or Series. Pandas offers a wide variety of options for subset selection which necessitates multiple articles. This series is broken down into the following 7 topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selection with `[]`, `.loc` and `.iloc`\n",
    "1. Boolean indexing\n",
    "1. Assigning subsets of data\n",
    "1. Selection with a MultiIndex\n",
    "1. Selecting subsets of data with methods\n",
    "1. Selections with other Index types\n",
    "1. Internals, Miscellaneous, and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "When you see the word **assign** used during a discussion on programming, it usually means that a variable is set equal to some value. For most programming languages, this means using the equal sign. For instance, to assign the value 5 to the variable **`x`** in Python, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is formally called an [assignment statement][1]. More generally, we can define Python assignment statements as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "variable = expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is quite a bit more to the [Python assignment statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html), but for our purposes it just means using the equal sign to store the object on the right-hand side to the left-hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation on Assigning subsets of data\n",
    "There isn't one particular sub-section of the documentation that covers this topic precisely. Several examples are available throughout the entire [indexing section](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does this have to do with selecting subsets of data?\n",
    "In this article, we will use the assignment statement, but only after we select a subset of data. We will be doing our subset selection based on what we learned from [part 1](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c) and [part 2](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-39e811c81a0c) and changing just those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left-hand side will have our subset selection and the right-hand side will contain our new values like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "subset_of_DataFrame_or_Series = new_values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Small Sample Dataset\n",
    "During this tutorial, we will be working with a small sample of the [employee](Dataset%20Descriptions.ipynb#Employee-Data) dataset. The small dataset will help us immediately see the changes. Let's take a look at this dataset now, which uses the index to store the names of each employee.\n",
